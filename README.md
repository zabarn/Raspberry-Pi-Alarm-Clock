# Raspberry-Pi-Alarm-Clock
This is a custom built Raspberry Pi 4 Alarm Clock. It is programmed specifically to be used with the Eviciv 7" 1024x600 IPS display. If you are using a different display you will need to change window, font, and button sizes to work with your display.

MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THIS FOLDER TO THE DESKTOP IF YOU WANT YOUR PI TO RUN IT ON DOWNLOAD. OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE TO GO INTO THE CODE AND CHANGE THE FILE PATHS FOR THE ALARM SOUND AND THE BACKGROUND PICTURES.

Here are some helpful tips when setting up your program to work best as an Alarm Clock:

Change your machine's settings so that the screen does not turn off and no screensaver is displayed. You may want to dim the screen when not in use if that is an option.

Set up your Alarm Clock to run as soon as your Raspberry Pi boots to the Desktop. Here is a video on how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZa1oCSdbUk The python file you will want to run is pialarm.py.

Make sure you have the WiFi networks you will use this on set up. Your Raspberry Pi needs the internet to get the correct time. If you plan on taking the device with you when you travel, you will have to bring a keyboard with you to kill the program and access the WiFi settings. Here is how to preset WiFi connections with the Terminal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgjwVFTsxZM

You may choose to install other fonts if you are using this on an operating system besides Raspbian. Make sure you go in and change that in the code.

P.S. you may have to click the window when it first boots up for the time to update itself.
